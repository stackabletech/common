= Stackable Config

This project provides utility functions and structs around the `clap` crate to make handling CLI arguments consistent within the Stackable platform.

WARNING: We don't really use this project much because it turned out to be too limiting in use. The only project using it is the `agent`. As such this will probably be either rewritten or deleted at some point.
